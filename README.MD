## What It Is

**ArduRMMMQ for Arduino® FreeRTOS**

ArduRMMMQ teaches you how multiple sensors will work at the same time using Arduino FreeRTOS. It will contribute greatly to both a hobby and a school lesson.

## How To Use

1. Clone the Arduino project to your computer by executing the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dentrax/ArduRMMMQ.git
```

2. Navigate to your `ArduRMMMQ` folder: 
```
cd ArduRMMMQ/
```

3. Open your `ArduRMMMQ.ino` file; compile and upload to the an Arduino board 

## Features

* Suitable for new FreeRTOS learners

* Multiple sensors can work at the same time

* Highly understandable code structure

* Easily replaceable define variables

* High performance and efficient memory usage

* Rich content with screenshots and circuit diagrams

## Requirements

* You should be familiar with C programming
* You will need a text editor (i.e Sublime Text) or IDE (i.e Arduino IDE)
* You will need an Arduino electronic programming platform (If you want to test with USB cable) - (Skip this if you have an Arduino Virtual Simulator or Proteus)
* You will need a computer on which you have the rights to install Arduino dependencies

## Dependencies

* Arduino Development Libaries (for building)
* The FreeRTOS Kernel for Arduino (Arduino_FreeRTOS.h)

## About

ArduRMMMQ was created to serve three purposes:

**ArduRMMMQ teaches you how multiple sensors will work at the same time using Arduino FreeRTOS**

1. To act as a guide to teach how Arduino and Raspberry PI communicating with enhanced and rich content

2. To provide a simplest and easiest way to learn detailed and interesting things about FreeRTOS

3. There is a source for you to develop own Raspberry PI module (like MagicMirror module) in RTOS and inreace your Arduino programming level
